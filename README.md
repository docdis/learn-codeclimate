## Paying for it

As with all great services, there is a
[price](https://codeclimate.com/pricing) to pay for
using CodeClimate (with *private* projects).  
Its *easy* to fall into the trap of thinking
$99 per month is "expensive"... But I suggest you
> *Think of **CodeClimate** as a **member of your team**
> who's **job** is to  
> **code-review** and alert people when code gets better or worse*.

If you're still having trouble convincing your "boss"
that $99 per month is *cheap* for a "second pair of eyes" on your code,  
***try it***  (*free*) for your personal (open source) GitHub projects
learn what code quality looks like and then try again.
